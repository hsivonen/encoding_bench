# encoding_bench

This is a performance testing framework for understanding the performance
characteristics of [encoding_rs](https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs).

This framework is separate from encoding_rs itself in order to separate
nightly-only Rust features (`#bench`) and CC-licensed test data from the main
repository.
